## Ruby wrapper for the Edmunds Vehicle API (V1)

This API wrapper will allow you to make calls to the Edmunds Vehicle API to get detailed information about nearly any make, model, and style (trim).
You can also get production images for each vehicle.

See a simple front-end demo using this gem:

http://edmunds.herokuapp.com

Code for frontend can be found here:

https://github.com/johndavid400/vehicular

## Setup:

First, include the gem in your Gemfile:

    vim Gemfile

    gem 'edmunds_ruby'

    bundle

Or if using from the console, just install the gem:

    gem install 'edmunds_ruby'

Now add your API key

### Get Edmunds Vehicle API key:

You will need to create an account with Edmunds and get a free developer Vehicle API key from here:

    http://developer.edmunds.com

Once you get your API key, either create an initializer file to place it in OR add it to your .bashrc script

#### option 1 - put api key in an initializer file:

Create a new file in config/initializers called edmunds.rb, like so:

    vim config/initializers/edmunds.rb

Add this line, with your api key:

    Rails.configuration.edmunds_vehicle_api_key = "your_api_key_here"

Save the file and exit.


#### option 2 - put api key in your .bashrc script:

Open .bashrc file:

    vim ~/.bashrc

Add this line near the top of the file:

    export EDMUNDS_VEHICLE="your_api_key_here"

Save and close the file, then source the file to make the changes take effect:

    source ~/.bashrc

Now you can use the Vehicle API as you like.

### Verify API key:

Open a console and try this:

    Edmunds::API.new.api_key

You should see your API key returned... if not, go back to the above steps and verify that you have it in an initializer or your bashrc script as described.


## Usage:

To use the gem, open a console and start playing.
There are currently 5 classes you can call: Make, Model, ModelYear, Style, and Photo

Some of the methods require inputs, others do not. Let's try an easy one first:

    m = Edmunds::Make.new
    m.find_all

This should return a list of all vehicle makes in the system.

For the Model class, you will have to provide an id first (which you can get from a Make response)

    m = Edmunds::Model.new
    m.find_by_id("Lamborghini_Diablo")

## Here is a complete list of available methods:

The method descriptions were pulled from the Edmunds API documentation.

    http://developer.edmunds.com/api-documentation/vehicle/

The method names in this wrapper were kept as close to the original Edmunds API method names as possible, to avoid confusion.

While I plan on wrapping the entire Vehicle API, I currently only have the Make, Model, ModelYear, Style, and Photo methods covered.

#### Edmunds::Make.new

    for_year_make_model(year, make, model)                           # Get a list of model years for a specific make, model and year

#### Edmunds::Style.new

http://developer.edmunds.com/docs/read/the_vehicle_api/Style_Repository

    find_by_id(style_id)                              # Get a style details by the style ID
    find_styles_by_make_model_year(make, model, year) # Get a list of styles by make, model and year
    find_styles_by_model_year_id(model_year_id)       # Get a list of styles by model year ID

#### Edmunds::Equipment.new

Documentation for these methods was derived from the API console page:

http://developer.edmunds.com/io-docs

    find_engines_by_style_id(style_id)         # Get engine details by the style ID (includes Horsepower)
    find_transmissions_by_style_id(style_id)   # Get transmission details by the style ID

#### Edmunds::Photo.new

http://developer.edmunds.com/docs/read/the_vehicle_api/Photos

    find_by_style_id(style_id)          # Get an array of photo detail objects for a particular vehicle style
    find_sample_by_style_id(style_id)   # Get a sample photo url for a particular vehicle style - tries to get a exterior front view image if available.

Note that the image arrays returned by the find_photos_by_style_id() method return an array of image links that will still need the base url attached to them in order to view the image.

The image base url can be accessed from any of the classes, for instance these all return the same image base url:

    Edmunds::API.new.image_base_url
    Edmunds::Make.new.image_base_url
    Edmunds::Photo.new.image_base_url

or if you set the new instance to a variable:

    p = Edmunds::Photo.new
    p.image_base_url

Will both return the base url (url prefix) that must be prepended to the links returned by the Photo API method.

With this in mind, I added that last photo method to grab a sample url for an image of any style, then go ahead and add the image base url to the beginning, thus making a valid url that you can click on to see the image... it is not listed as an Edmunds API method, but I found it useful.
